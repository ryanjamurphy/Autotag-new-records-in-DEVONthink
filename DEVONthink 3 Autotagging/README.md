# About and instructions
These scripts help you manage tags in [DEVONthink](https://devontechnologies.com/) macOS apps. In particular, [`Autotag with concordance`](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/augcog/blob/master/DEVONthink%203%20Autotagging/README.md#Autotag-with-concordance) allows you to establish an auto tagging system with DT3â€™s smart rules.
